        The other news is that we've finally finished the record. Jason Livermore from the Blasting Room did an excellent job mastering the record and we're extremely excited to share the album with everyone. We’re currently in the search for a label interested in putting out the record. In the meantime, Gaston put together a video for the song "Never Needed" which will appear in the new record. Check it out below.<br>

        <strong>MAJOR UPDATE!!!</strong> We have finished tracking our upcoming full length record. The tracking was done at Pinecrust Studios in Miami by Ryan Haft and is currently being mixed by Darian Rundall (Credits include: Pennywise, Strung Out, Dokken) and will be mastered at the Blasting Room by Jason Livermore. We couldn't be happier to have such a good team working on our full length and we’re excited to release it. We're currently shopping around with labels all over the world.<br>
        While waiting on the record to be mixed and mastered, we have been practicing and writing some new material as well as getting ready for Florida Supercon in July. Make sure you check us out as we'll be playing many songs from the upcoming album.<br>
