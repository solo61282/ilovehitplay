Hit Play! ended their year on a positive note, playing a New Year's Eve show with Fat Wreck Chord's Dead to Me and Cobra Skulls. They flew all the way from California just for this special occasion. Super nice guys and they both rocked it. We rung in the New Year during the middle of the Cobra Skulls Set.</p>

Those of you haven't check those guys out as they are one of South Florida's best punk bands. We will have more info regarding the release date of the cover song soon.</p>
